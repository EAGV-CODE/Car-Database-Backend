# Car-Database-Backend

In this application I have worked with Eclipse IDE and Spring Boot framework, using Spring initializr to create the project and using MariaDB als DB and HeidiSQL als graphics DB interface. I used JPA ( Java Persistent API) to create tables into DB with Hibernate (Java based JPA implementation). I created entity classes to build tables and table's fields; and CRUD repositories classes for each entity. I used Spring Data Rest to create RESTful web service which return a JSON data in the HAL format (Hypertext Application Language) that provides a set of conventions for expressing hyperlinks in JSON, and I used Postman (tool for testing and consuming RESTful Web Services) to check everything. I have used for authentication JWT (JSON Web Tokens) using JWT library and for testing I used JUnit (Java-based unit testing library) and MockMvc for testing RESTful web service JWT authentication funcionality. For deploying purposes I have used Heroku cloud server and JawsDB (Database as a Service(DBaaS)) to install MariaDB database.
